GDP 2010 = 6233554306496.0

GDP 2020 = 16215179397824.0

GDP 2022 = 18976748596928.0

### Questions

#### Please, submit a Python solution and elaborate on the following questions related to it:

#### What type/s of regression have you applied?

Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression


#### How accurate is your solution?

The Linear Regression solution is not accurat at all, but the Polynomial Regression solution is better, still not 100% perfect but still acceptable

#### What else could be done for improvement of the accuracy?

Maybe bigger test data, or other regression framework/tool
